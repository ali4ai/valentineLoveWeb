          <p>
          If you are reading this, it means you have reached the end of this small journey I created… 
          but the truth is, our real journey is just beginning.
          </p>

          <p>
          From that unexpected message that changed everything… to every moment we have shared since then… 
          you have filled my life with happiness I never knew I was missing. 
          You came into my world quietly, but your love changed my entire life beautifully.
          </p>

          <p>
          You are not just someone I love…  
          You are my comfort when I feel tired,  
          My smile when life feels heavy,  
          And my peace when the world feels confusing.
          </p>

          <p>
          Every day with you teaches me how beautiful love can be. 
          You make my heart feel safe, understood, and complete. 
          I thank Allah for writing your name in my destiny, because loving you has been the most beautiful blessing of my life.
          </p>

          <p>
          I promise to stand beside you in happiness and in hardship. 
          I promise to respect you, protect your heart, and support your dreams. 
          I promise to be your partner, your best friend, and the person you can always rely on.
          </p>

          <p>
          Sumia, you are my today, my tomorrow, and every dream I have for the future.
          </p>

          <p>
          No matter where life takes us, one thing will always remain true…  
          My heart will always choose you.
          </p>
